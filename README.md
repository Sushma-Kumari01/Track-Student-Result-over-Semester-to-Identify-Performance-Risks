Student Performance Progression & Risk Analyzer
Description
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
It processes real-world student score data to identify performance patterns, measure consistency, detect difficult subjects, and classify students into risk categories (High, Moderate, Low).
The system also generates visual reports such as bar charts and pie charts to support academic decision making.
